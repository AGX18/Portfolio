        I'm always interested in hearing about internship opportunities, job
        offers, networking events, or workshops related to software engineering.
        I am eager to learn about any openings for roles that involve software
        development, coding, or technology innovation. Additionally, I am keen
        on receiving information about career fairs, tech talks, and any
        resources that could help me grow as a software engineer."
